Syn Package Manager
=====================

**Syn, the package manager with a better F/OSS record then GNU Emacs!**

Syn's a package manager for a new era. A new era of fast-as-balls computers,
stupid upstream packaging practices, and automated services doing the grunt
work.

Syn is a blend of contrast. Simplified yet exposed. Fast yet careful.

Syn places control in your lap where you want it, and works to save you from
the stuff you don't.

Since Syn was designed and given lots of love in the post web2.0-era, we're
using all sorts of nifty design practices and conventions most would find better
then the traditional methods of yee olde time.

Syn's style is taken very lightly from dpkg, but with some interesting (and 
sometimes questionable) twists.

With love,
The Synners.
